In the summer of 2017 I started a softare project with some friends to develop 
a platform to help occupants get the most out of the buildings they use everyday.
The concept was simple: use new technologies in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization
And Mapping), ML (Machine Learning), and AR (Augmented Reality) to make a spatial 
interactive interface for occupants to add information their environment to a 
shared database, and query it in a similarly spatial way. The application we focused 
on linked these concepts of immersive computing with facility management.
Occupants would be empowered to collaborate amongst themselves and with building 
operators to improve their buildings in small but meaningful ways.

We quickly set up some test code for the website and got into researching [object
detection](https://youtu.be/MPU2HistivI). 

We scheduled meetings with facility managers, building owners, and building occupants
to see what pain points we could address. 

The ETH Facility Management team was very open and gave us several interviews. 

From our interviews with residential 
facility managers it was apparent that they spent a significant portion of their 
day responding to emails and co-ordinating times to enter flats.
