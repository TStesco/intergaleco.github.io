In Autumn of 2017 I worked on a building retrofit project with [Paco Bos][Paco]
as part of the Integrated Design Project in our Masters programme. We explored
concepts of how the retrofit of a commercial-residential building was part of 
the wider district redevelopment. For this reason we named the project "The Node". 
These [presentation slides][presentation] gives
a nice summary of the project but I'll provide a quick overview here. Also, 
checkout our [report][report] for further details.

At district level the heating network was expanding, making the reduction of
heating demand attractive to ease the transition. Mobility was also a central
theme of the project as we wanted to add cyclist infrastructure (lanes and 
parking/lock-ups) and increase pedestrian connectivity through the building at
street level.

We wanted to have a positive environmental, social, and economic outcome so we
proposed several measures to reduce the heating and cooling loads in the building. 
These energy savings were individually packaged as postive ROI investment options. 
We also plan a large solar photovoltaic (PV) installation on the rooftop to offset
the large electricity demand from the building tenants and lighting. A rooftop garden and collective
space was also planned for the roof. The collective space being underneath large 
pavillions that provide shade and additional area for PV panels. The pavillions 
do cause some shading effect on the lower level which we calculated.

The partially shaded areas and one side of the roof lower level were proposed as 
garden area. We didn't want to have the roof be exclusive to energy production 
and thought that this could be an interesting place for the community to gather. 
Underneath the pavillions was proposed as a place for a local tenant-based group 
to define with supplied water and electrical connections. Some improvements were
planned to make this possible, for example acoustic insulation in the roof. Additionally, the 
building air exhausts that penetrated the roof were extended with built-in 
seating around them.

The building envelope improvements were targeted to reduce the heating load and 
provide a more unique aesthetic. We chose wood as the facade material because of 
its ubiquity in Switzerland and low environmental impact. This could be applied 
as a new set of layers including insulation, over the existing plaster facade.

With all the improvements planned the net energy demand was reduced by an estimated
 38%, from 141 W/m2-a to 88 W/m2-a. However the primary energy is reduced by a
larger 62%, and carbon intensity is reduced by 38%. Interestingly DHW and room 
electricity accounted for 36.7% and 30.4% of post-retrofit demand respectively. 
It's clear that focusing in the actual usage by occupants is key 
to better energy performance.
