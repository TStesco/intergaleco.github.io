user_description_short: |
  I'm a data scientist and control research engineer at [ecobee](https://www.ecobee.com/), born and living in Toronto Canada.
  I did my MSc at ETH ZÃ¼rich in [Integrated Building Systems](http://www.master-buildingsystems.ethz.ch/) after finishing my BASc at University of Waterloo.
  My overarching interests are in systems engineering for virtuous feedback loops between smart machines, people, and their environment.
