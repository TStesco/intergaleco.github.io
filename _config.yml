  I’m currently trying to understand how AI models (née transformers) scaling with combined hardware + algorithmic advances transforms different application domains, and the software infrastructure enabling them to work reliably.

user_description_short: |
  I’m working at [Tenstorrent](https://www.tenstorrent.com), an AI hardware company that cares about customers owning their silicon and software, as a Senior Staff Field Application Engineer specializing in AI/ML software.
  I went to school at ETH Zürich (MS) and University of Waterloo (BASc).
  My interests are in virtuous feedback between machines, people, and their environment (or put differently, exploring cities).
